# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis was to create a ride-sharing summary dataframe sorted by city type and create a multiple-line chart of total fairs for each city type.

## Results

This dataframe shows that the Total Drivers to Total Rides ratio greatly influences the Average Fare per Ride. There were roughly 38% fewer Total Drivers than there were Total Rides in Rural. For Suburban cities, there were about 22% fewer Total Drivers than there were Total Rides, so the Average Fare per Ride is a bit lower. However, in Urban cities, there were roughly 48% more Total Drivers than there were Total Rides. The dataframe seems to show that increasing the number of drivers leads to a decrease in average fare price.

This multiple-line chart displays the total fare for each month per city type. Even though Urban cities had lower Average Fare per Ride, they had significantly more Total Rides, so they made much more money. The chart indicates that the number of rides increases as the population of a city increases. The chart might also indicate that when the price is lower, people are more likely to use the service. Late February seems to be a particularly active time for the company in all regions.

## Summary

One recommendation would be to focus on increasing the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas to help drive down the Fare per Ride. Hopefully, doing so would incentivize more people in Rural and Suburban cities to use PyBer with its lower prices. As for Urban cities, it might be helpful to reduce the number of drivers. While doing so would drive up the price a bit, it is clear that there are significantly more drivers than the demand for drivers.
